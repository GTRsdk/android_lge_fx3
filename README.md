Cyanogenmod 10 Device tree Optimus f3 Virgin Mobile
=======================
```
This is an attempt to create a cyanogenmod 10 device tree
for the LG Optimus F3 Virgin Mobile Phone.

It's based off of the 'booting' rom ported from the Korean LG Optimus F7
http://androidforums.com/threads/rom-alpha-4-1-2-cyanogenmod-10-0-unofficial.879041/

This is a work in progress. At this stage the device tree is still being created
and has not been confirmed to work. This readme will be updated with this 
device tree is confirmed to boot 'as is'
```
